# Difference between JOIN and UNION

*JOINS* and *UNIONS* are different things. However, this question is being asked very frequently now. UNION combines the result-set of two or more select queries into a single result-set which includes all the rows from all the queries in the union, where as JOINS, retrieve data from two or more tables based on logical relationships between the tables. In short, UNION combines rows from 2 or more tables, where JOINS combine columns from 2 or more table.
